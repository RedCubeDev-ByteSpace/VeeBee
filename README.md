A portable Visual Basic runtime, made to be integrated into larger projects as a scripting language.


This runtime is based on Microsofts "Visual Basic for Applications" (VBA) runtime, a continuation of Microsofts commercial "Visual Basic 6.0". Therefore it is the most robust, stable and consistent of all the different Visual Basic standards.
