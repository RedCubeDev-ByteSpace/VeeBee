A portable Visual Basic runtime, made to be integrated into larger projects as a scripting language.


This runtime is based on Microsofts ["Visual Basic for Applications" (VBA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications) runtime, a continuation of the commercial ["Visual Basic 6.0"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)). As far as I know it is the most robust, stable and consistent of all the different Visual Basic standards.
